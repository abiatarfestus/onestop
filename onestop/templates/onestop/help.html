        <ul>
            <li><em>Kindness</em>: We strive to be a kind community. Be nice and helpful to people, even if you're
                frustrated. Give constructive feedback on proposals and explain why you are rejecting a proposal if
                that’s the case.</li>
            <li><em>Originality</em>: Do not copy directly from any other dictionaries or sources. Other dictionaries
                are often strictly licensed, and it's our aim to build a unique and novel online dictionary.</li>
            <li><em>Sourced</em>: Give sources for proposals where possible and appropriate. Especially when suggesting
                new words or meanings, a source for your proposal is essential. Examples of good sources include
                nationally recognized newspapers, magazines, and academic publications.</li>

                </svg></a>Meanings and Examples</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Avoid the use of gendered pronouns. Instead of using "he" or "she," employ the singular "they.” For
                example, "They tried sushi for the first time." There is significant <a
                    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they" rel="nofollow">historical precedent</a> for this
                usage.</li>
            <li>Avoid the passive voice where possible. For example, "The dog chased the cat," is better than "The cat
                was chased by the dog."</li>
            <li>Start example sentences with a capital letter and end sentences with appropriate punctuation.</li>
            <li>Start all verb definitions with the word “to.” For example, the definition of hurt might read, “to cause
                damage or pain.”</li>
            <li>Try to provide context in example sentences. For example, if you are defining the word umbrella, “I like
                umbrellas,” is a bad example sentence. Someone who doesn't know what the word umbrella means would have
                a difficult time guessing what the word means based off of that. Instead, try sentences such as, “Since
                it was raining, I grabbed my gray umbrella to keep myself dry.”</li>
            <li>Avoid parenthetical citations. They break up definitions and often indicate unessential or extraneous
                information.</li>
            <li>Use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma" rel="nofollow">Oxford comma</a>. For
                example, write “I want to buy a calculator, a book, and a pencil,” as opposed to writing, “I want to buy
                a calculator, a book and a pencil.”</li>

                </svg></a>Words and Phrases</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Avoid adding phrases or groups of words that are merely "X+Y" definitions. These dictionary entries are
                comprised of string of texts can be defined by defining each individual part of the entry. For example,
                "young boy" would be a bad dictionary entry or phrase to add since its definition would just be a
                combination of the definitions for "young" and "boy." Phrases like "yellow journalism" are acceptable
                since they have a definition which is not merely "X+Y."</li>
            <li>Our goal is to create a dictionary, so avoid adding words or phrases that belong in an encyclopedia,
                almanac, or any otherwise resource that isn't a dictionary. For example, Streptococcus pneumoniae does
                not belong in a dictionary.</li>

                <p>Oshinglish Online is a website built on Django framework. This website (or project, in Django speak) is aimed to be
                    a one-stop site for information relating to Oshiwambo culture and language. The website comprises of
                    five main sections (or web apps, in Django speak), namely: <a href="">Blog</a>, <a
                        href="">Books</a>, <a href="{% url 'dictionary:search' %}">Dictionary</a>, <a
                        href="">Events</a>, and
                    <a href="">Editing</a>. This help page provides guidelines and helpful information on how to
                    interact with each
                    application. To view this information, click on the headings below.</p>
                <h4>General guidelines</h4>
                <p>This website is meant to be built a community of users and contributors; thus, it is important to
                    have some guidelines, to which all users must adhere. These are general guidelines that apply across
                    the whole site. App-specific guidelines are stipulated under the help section of each app below. The
                    overall goal of Oshinglish is to build a site with reliable, educative and accessible content. Hence
                    the following principles matter:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Kindness</em>: This is a community driven site, so by all stretch make yourself useful to
                        other. Be nice and helpful to people, even when you share a different opinion from theirs. Give
                        constructive feedback and only add value.</li>
                    <li><em>Originality</em>: In adding definitions and examples, make an effort to be original and
                        avoid copying directly from other sources. The same is not expected for idioms, for obvious
                        reasons, of course.
                    </li>
                    <li><em>Generosity</em>: Be generous with your knowledge, and share what you know.</li>

                <h4>Oshinglish Dictionary</h4>
                <p>Oshinglish Dictionary is a multilingual dictionary of English and Oshindonga (read Oshiwambo).
                    Considering that there is a fair share of English dictionaries online, the focus of this dictionary
                    is on Oshindonga (again, read Oshiwambo). Okay, let’s clarify the issue of Oshindonga vs Oshiwambo.
                    Oshiwambo has about eight dialects (Oshindonga, Oshikwanyama, Oshikwambi, Oshimbaantu, Oshimbadja,
                    Oshingandjera, Oshikwaluudhi, Oshikolonkadhi), but for the purpose of this application, one was
                    chosen. The reasons being: one, for standardisation purpose (that is, to have a dictionary that is
                    consistent in its content), and two, out of the two commonly used dialects in education (i.e.,
                    Oshindonga and Oshikwanyama), the web developer is more comfortable with the former. However, effort
                    is made for words to be represented in various dialects through inclusion of synonyms. The good
                    part, yet again, is that this site is by no means cast in stone. That is to say suggestions for
                    changes and improvements are welcome.</p>
                <p>While the focus of the dictionary is on Oshindonga (you can continue reading Oshiwambo), English is
                    an integral part of the dictionary by design. As a matter of fact, an English word is the first
                    point of entry for every record in the database. This is both a design choice and a convenience
                    matter, enabling the dictionary to be searchable using both English and Oshindonga words. To clarify
                    this, the process of updating the database/dictionary with new entries follows the following
                    pattern:</p>
                <p><strong>English word --> Oshindonga word --> Definition (& or Oshindonga Idiom) --> Example</strong>
                    <br><br>
                    This means an English word needs to be entered first before its Oshindonga equivalent. An Oshindonga
                    word (or words) is added as a translation (or translations) of the English word that already exists
                    in the database. Once an English-Oshindonga pair is created, it can then be defined. Therefore, no
                    definition can be added in the absence of the pair to be defined from the database. (At this point
                    an Oshindonga idiom can also be added.) Once a definition exists, usage examples of that meaning can
                    be added both in English and Oshindonga.

                Following are detailed instructions on how to add and modify entries in the dictionary (NB: Only
                registered users are able to add and modify entries):
                <h4>Adding English words</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>To add an English word click <a href="{% url 'dictionary:english-create' %}">Add English
                            Words</a> on the menu.</li>
                    <li>English words should be unique, which mean no more than one exact same English words can be
                        added (you will understand why, hopefully). Thus, one way to check whether an English word
                        already exists, apart from search it on the search page, is by attempting to add it. If it goes
                        through, it never existed; if it exists, it will display a duplicate error message.</li>
                    <li>Enter the English word and choose the word case, that is, whether it’s a normal word,
                        abbreviation, or proper noun. (This option allows the system to capitalise the word
                        appropriately before saving it to the database. By default normal is selected). Click submit to
                        save the entry.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Adding Oshindonga words</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>To add an English word click <a href="{% url 'dictionary:oshindonga-create' %}">Add English
                            Words</a> on the menu.</li>
                    <li>Unlike English words, Oshindonga words don’t need to be unique. The same word can be entered
                        more than once as long as it’s linked to different English words. Thus, pairs should be unique,
                        no more than one exact same English-Oshindonga pairs should exist. (To exemplify, the word
                        “omweelo” can exist more than once in the following pairs: gate|omweelo & door|omweelo).</li>
                    <li>When adding an Oshindonga word, first choose the corresponding English word from the dropdown
                        list (See why English words need to be entered first?). Enter the Oshindonga word, select the
                        words case as described under English section above, choose the phonetics characteristics (if
                        available), then click submit to save the entry.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Adding definitions</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>To add a definition click <a href="{% url 'dictionary:definition-create' %}">Add Definitions</a>
                        on the menu.</li>
                    <li>To avoid duplicate definitions, first ascertain that the definition you wish to enter does not
                        already by searching the words you wish to define on the search page.</li>
                    <li>To add a definition first select the word pair you wish to define from the dropdown list
                        (Tips: while on this page, the right sidebar will display random word pairs that have not yet
                        been defined). </li>
                    <li>Once a word pair is selected, choose the part of speech of the definition (e.g., noun, verb,
                        etc.). Depending on the part of speech selected, extra options, such as verb tenses or noun
                        plurals in Oshindonga, may be displayed. </li>
                    <li>Next, you may add Oshindonga synonyms of the word you’re defining (this is where you can bring
                        in the version of that word in other dialects). </li>
                    <li>Finally, add the English definition and the corresponding Oshindonga definition and click
                        submit to save the entry.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Adding usage examples</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>To add usage examples to a definition click <a href="{% url 'dictionary:example-create' %}">Add
                            Definitions Examples</a> on the menu.</li>
                    <li>To add an example, first select the definition you wish to exemplify from the dropdown list
                        (Tips: while on this page, the right sidebar will display random definitions that have not yet
                        been exemplified). </li>
                    <li>Once a definition is selected, add the English example and the corresponding Oshindonga
                        example and click submit to save the entry.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Adding Oshindonga idioms</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>To add Oshindonga idioms click <a href="{% url 'dictionary:oshindonga-idiom-create' %}">Add
                            Oshindonga Idioms</a> on the menu.</li>
                    <li>To add an idiom, first select the word pair that has an Oshindonga word that features in the
                        idiom you wish to add.</li>
                    <li>Finally, enter the idiom and its meaning; then click submit to save it to the database.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Adding Oshindonga Phonetics</h4>
                <strong><em>To be implemented later</em></strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>To add Oshindonga phonetics click <a href="">Add
                            Oshindonga Phonetics</a> on the menu.</li>
                    <li>Phonetic characteristics (pronunciations and phonetic transcriptions) live in a separate table
                        (or model in Django speak) in the database, which is different from the table for Oshindonga
                        words referred to above. This table is not linked to the English table, and thus it can be
                        updated with Oshindonga words regardless of whether corresponding English words exist or nah.
                        This table contains [unique] Oshindonga words with their pronunciations and phonetic
                        transcriptions. These phonetics characteristics can then be made available to the Oshindonga
                        words in the other main table/model by means of foreign key reference to this table.</li>
                    <li>Adding entries to this table involves…</li>

                <h4>Important conventions</h4>
                For consistency sake, it is required that contributors observe the following entry conventions:
                <ul>
                    <li>By convention, when entering new words (both English and Oshindonga), all ordinary/normal words
                        will be saved in all small caps. Proper nouns are saved with the first letter capitalised while
                        abbreviations are saved in all caps.</li>
                    <li>While the above formatting is, by large, applied automatically based on the word case option
                        chosen, contributors should always strive to enter words with appropriate casing.</li>
                    <li>If you’ve ever been in an English class (of course, you have), you’ve probably heard that active
                        voice is better than passive voice. So why not go for the better (where possible)? In both
                        languages, that is. For example, "The boy kicked the ball." is apparently better than "The ball
                        was kicked by the boy."</li>
                    <li>Start example sentences with a capital letter and end sentences with appropriate punctuation.
                    </li>
                    <li>Definition entries in both languages should start with a lower case letter.</li>
                    <li>Start all English verb definitions with the word “to.” For example, the definition of kill might
                        read, “to end the life of…” (or something like that, really). If you think this is a ridiculous
                        definition, wait until you start entering some yourself. Start all Oshindonga verb definitions
                        with the word “oku.” For example, the definition of dhipaga might read, “oku hulitha po
                        omwenyo…” Smh…not even Oshindonga is easy.</li>
                    <li>Avoid simplistic, stock examples. Make an effort to provide context in examples. For example, if
                        you are defining the word okalunda (or is it okandunda), “Ondi hole okalunda,” is of little help
                        to someone who doesn't know what the word okalunda means, and they would have a hard time making
                        out its meaning from that. A better revision of that example would read, “Molwashoka okwa li ta
                        u lokwa, onda kutha okalunda kandje ha okaluudhe opo kandi mote/tute.”</li>
